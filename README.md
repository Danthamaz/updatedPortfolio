# updatedPortfolio

This portfolio showcases my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript talents as of June 2018.

On this website I created my first parallax effect, however I have had difficulties getting that same effect to render correctly in 
browsers other than Chrome. The effect also does not currently work on mobile. 

I plan to continue to update this code as I develop my programming skills to keep it up to date with my newest projects and accomplishments.
